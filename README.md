# 환영 HwanYoung 幻影

## Short description

HwanYoung is an Unreal Engine 4 based action RPG project that hopes to explore some, if not all, social/interpersonal issues that are prevalent in today's society and amplify the voices of those who are affected by these issues through in-game lore. Its style, gameplay, and lore are heavily inspired by Korean culture and folklore. While we want to have our creative touch to this game project, we also try our best to stay as culturally accurate as possible. If you have any suggestions about the game project or want to make your own contributions, please contact me!

## Where we are in the process

### Current: 2023.01.05 

* LORE: Outlines of the in-game lore, character lore, mob lore are complete and ready to be written more narratively. Some discussions on adding more character development throughout gameplay are happening. Final incentives behind the main antagonist are still being finalized.
* DESIGN: Third draft of playable character designs (minus the weapon designs) is completed; we are currently recruiting people who can 3D model characters based on the designs. We have a basic structure of the in-game world, but the structures of each level are still upon discussion. 
* GAMEPLAY: Currently in the process of setting up CPP assets before using GameplayAbilitySystem (GAS) API; the gameplay styles (active/passive skills, melee/projectile normal attacks, types of weapons) are conceptualized and the maths behind the abilities are roughly planned out, though subject to change.
